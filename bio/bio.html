        <h2>Biographie / Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Nat Mayer Shapiro was born in New York City in 1919 and spent his
            childhood and adolescence in Brooklyn. He was 10 when he decided he
            would be an artist and started attending the after-school programs at
            Pratt Institute. Inducted in the army in 1941, he was sent with the
            Medical Corps to Australia and New Guinea where he spent most of his four
            years and half of military life. Upon his return to the States, he spent
            eight months in the R&amp;R (Rest &amp; Rehabilitation) Center in Lake Placid,
            NY, where he was finally able to work as an artist, painting stage sets,
            portraits and landscapes. In 1945, the War Department acquired some of
            Nat’s artwork for the then-planned War Museum.

            Back into civilian life, Nat worked as a commercial artist while
            attending classes at the Art Students League in New York City. In 1951,
            married and father of two children, he moved to Chicago where he started
            discovering himself as a fine artist. An adventurous personality,
            curious of other worlds, of other cultures, and of other artistic
            trends, he moved with his family to Europe and settled in
            France. Surrounded by a historical cultural heritage, by magnificent
            architecture, by old and contemporary works of art, Nat’s artistic
            creation blossomed out. He tried different media, different techniques,
            different artistic outlets; the result was a variety of mature,
            original, sometimes powerful, sometimes whimsical works.

        <p>
            His various trips were of great influence and inspiration: the vaults of
            Byzantine churches, the mosaics of Ravenna, a Moroccan holy city. Nat
            had several exhibits while in France: Paris, Asnières, Marly-le-Roy,
            Auch. The French Ministry of Culture bought two of his works: a
            painting, <em>Pandora’s Box</em>, now hanging in the French Embassy in Oslo and
            <em>The Wall</em>, a very large, beautiful sculpture.

            In 1985, Nat returned to New York to reconnect with his roots and his
            past. He settled in Westchester and joined a group of artists who wanted
            to open a cooperative gallery. He was instrumental in locating, setting
            up and launching the new gallery, even found a great name for it:
            <em>Upstream</em>. When the gallery had to close, Nat persisted in regrouping
            the artists, in looking for a new space, in ascertaining that the new
            gallery would be a high-quality meeting of the arts. He was its
            president and an inspiration to his fellow members from 1995 to 2002.
            In addition to several exhibits at Upstream, Nat had shows in New York
            City, in Pisa (Italy), in Bologna (Italy) and his work was being
            acquired by prestigious collectors, such as Pfizer Learning Center, and private
            patrons in France, UK, USA, Gambia, Uganda, and Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nat Shapiro passed away in December 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
            A dynamic and athletic person, Nat loved golf and tennis and excelled in
            fencing, winning several gold and silver medals in this
            discipline. Having obtained a Prevost diploma from the French Sports
            Institute, for many years he taught fencing to children and adults in
            France and in the New York region, at SUNY Purchase and CCNY.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through all his artistic life Nat pursued his quest for depth, for a third
            dimension. He was fascinated by the infinity of the universe which he so
            beautifully depicted in his black and white 72”&times;202” (183 cm
            &times; 513 cm)
            canvas, titled <em>The
            Universe.</em> In the <em>Galaxy</em> series, he interpreted a very complex world in
            a simple, happy and light mood. In another series, <em>Kites</em>,
            different-shaped kites are floating, dancing in their
            surroundings. Whether they are whimsical or serious, strictly organized
            or loose, Nat’s works are never grim or stifled, they are joyful, they
            are dancing. They reflect the man who loved life, loved art and always
            looked forward, exploring various techniques to create something new,
            different and, for him, unusual.
